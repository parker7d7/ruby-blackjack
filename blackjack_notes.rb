#Classes
    #player
        #create the following accessable properties: *attr_accessor*
        #name

        #hand (array to store cards)

        class Player

#Gameplay
    #Player chooses their name
        #creates a new player class
    #Game start 
        #method: *deal* two random cards generated for house and player
            #sample method (grabs random items from array)
        #method: *add_cards* adds the two randomly generated cards for house and player
        #method: *compare* compare the total of cards generated for house and player 
        #method: *win* substracts 10 from the losing party and adds 10 to the winning party
            #tie > puts a message to the player. nothing is affected.
        
        ##consider writing a switch case statement to cover all situations
